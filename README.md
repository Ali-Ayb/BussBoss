> We designed BussBoss using wireframes and mockups, iterating on the design until we reached the ideal layout for easy navigation and a seamless user experience.

<!-- Tech stack -->
<img src="./readme/title5.svg"/>

### BussBoss is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [React Native app development framework](https://reactnative.dev/). React Native is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage and save it to a local database.

<br><br>

<!-- How to run -->
<img src="./readme/title6.svg"/>

> To set up BussBoss locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Install NPM from: [NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

- Install composer from: [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download)

- Database server: Any Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database server, recommended [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org)
  This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

## Installation

### First, Cloning and Installing Packages

_Below are the steps to follow to run the project_

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Ali-Ayb/BussBoss.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages for admin by opening terminal in `BussBoss-desktop` and run
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Install NPM packages for user react native by opening terminal in `BussBoss-mobile` and run
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Install Composer packages for server by opening terminal in `BussBoss-server` and run
   ```sh
   composer install
   ```
   Or if error occurs
   ```sh
   composer update
   ```

### Second, let's start the server

In `BussBoss-server`:

1. Copy `.env.example` file and rename it `.env` you can run
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Open your `.env` file and change the database name (DB_DATABASE) to whatever you need or to `bussboss_db`, username (DB_USERNAME) and password (DB_PASSWORD) field correspond to your configuration if you configured them.

3. Run the following command for larval ,JWT and Data Base (you must have your XAMPP server running)

   ```sh
      php artisan key:generate
   ```

   ```sh
      php artisan jwt:secret
   ```

   ```sh
      php artisan migrate
   ```

   ```sh
      php artisan storage:link
   ```

   ```sh
      php artisan serve --host <YOUR_LOCAL_IPv4@> --port 8000
   ```

   you can get your IPV4@ by running

   on windows

   ```sh
      ipconfig
   ```

   on linux

   ```sh
      ifconfig
   ```

### Now the Admin part

Go to `BussBoss-desktop`:

1. IN `\src\hooks\http-hook.js` change IP to you IPV4@ or server IP@

   ```js
   URL = "SERVER_IP@/api/ony";
   ```

2. In The Terminal Run

   ```sh
     npm start
   ```

   ### Finally for User Application

In `BussBoss-mobile` :

1. Copy "or Create" `.env.example` file and rename it `.env` you can run
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Add Server IP@ /Link
   ```js
      BASE_URL=<SERVER_IP>/api/ony
   ```
3. Add Your API Google Maps Key, You can follow [Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) to learn how to get one

   ```js
      GOOGLE_MAPS_APIKEY=<YOUR_KEY>
   ```

4. In `\hooks\request.js` change IP to you IPV4@ or server IP@

   ```js
   const URL = "SERVER_IP@/api/ony";
   ```

5. In The Terminal Run

   ```sh
     npx expo start
   ```

Congratulations, The App Must be Working Now.

Some Installation may be different on different OS.
The app was never tested on an ios devices .

Enjoy your tour and please provide me with feedback. ðŸŽ‰
